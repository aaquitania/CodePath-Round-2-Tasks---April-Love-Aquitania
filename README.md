# Scenario A

Hi Raju, 

We marked you as absent in your most recent CodePath iOS Course class because you were only able to attend for 10 minutes. 

[Our policy](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19#heading-attendance-and-coursework-submissions) states that students are required to complete at least half of the duration of their classes to be marked as present. The duration of your iOS Course class is 60 minutes and therefore, you are required to attend at least 30 minutes to be marked as present. 

Moving forward, please make sure that you are able to attend at least half of the class' duration to avoid being marked as absent. 

Please let us know if you have futher questions. 


All the best, 

CodePath Team
