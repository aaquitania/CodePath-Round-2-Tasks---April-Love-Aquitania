# Scenario B

Hello Pia, 

Thank you for reaching out and we appreciate your eagerness to commit to attend all the remaining sessions. However, it appears to us that you have an overwhelming load for the semester and has a full schedule due to work. As a result, you incur 4 consecutive absences, hence, we you were withdrawn from the course. 

But please know that we do give second chances for our students as long as we can see you have enough time to commit to your classes. We do understand and appreciate your eagerness but we don't want you to be overworked. We will offer you a slot next semester when you have less load and better availability.

Good luck and hoping to see you next semester. 


All the best, 


CodePath.org Team
